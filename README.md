 ðŸš€ **Hello, World! Iâ€™m Pablo, a seasoned Full Stack Data Scientist & ML Engineer!**

ðŸ“š **About Me:**
I have a mix of software engineering and strong math skills. I'm really good at Machine Learning (just love it), Big Data, and Cloud Engineering, and I work hard crafting AI/ML solutions at scale for Fortune 500 giants. As a full-stack AI practicioner, I integrate advanced theory with practical application seamlessly.

I'm particularly interested in Generative AI, always exploring ways to boost production in large enterprises by developing cost-efficient and scalable solutions.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning:** 
- **Complex Agent-Human Interaction:** Diving deep into the intricate dynamics of how automated agents and humans interact, aiming to enhance the synergy between users and AI-driven systems for optimized outcomes.
- **Reinforcement Learning Techniques:** Actively exploring and mastering various reinforcement learning strategies, focusing on developing intelligent agents that can adapt and excel in a myriad of environments and scenarios.
- **Large Language Models (LLM) Evaluation:** Engaged in the systematic evaluation of Large Language Models, understanding their strengths, limitations, and potentials, with particular emphasis on real-world applications and implications.
- **Latent Diffusion Algorithms:** Delving into the intricacies of latent diffusion algorithms, studying their efficiency, scalability, and performance, with an eye towards harnessing these powerful tools for robust and reliable AI solutions.
- **Azure Machine Learning prompt flow:** Azure Machine Learning prompt flow is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development cycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

ðŸŒŸ **Highlights:**
- Established & led an MLOps practice, deploying both real-time & batch ML solutions globally at [Concentrix](https://fortune.com/company/concentrix/fortune500/) consulting services.
- Principal author & designer of the MLOps accelerator framework at [Levi's & Co Tech](https://www.fortune.com/company/levi-strauss/fortune500/).
- Co-wrote, developed and engineered a set of Python SDK's (acting as open-source internally) at Levi's & Co Tech., simplifying ML model integration into software for large enterprises.
- Designed a state-of-the-art product classification & embedding generation system using advanced Computer Vision algorithms.
- Took the lead in elevating numerous algorithms to production-grade ML systems within Fortune 500 enterprises during my consulting stage at Concentrix! From conception to deployment !

ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:** 
- Open-source challenges, innovative product ideas, and partnerships with bright beginners and experienced scientists alike.
