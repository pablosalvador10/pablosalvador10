  <summary><h4>üîç What I‚Äôm currently working on</h4></summary>
  
  - **Complex Agent-Human Interaction:** Diving deep into the intricate dynamics of how automated agents and humans interact, aiming to enhance the synergy between users and AI-driven systems for optimized outcomes.
  - **Multi-Agent Architectures:** Designing and implementing multi-agent architectures to solve real-world problems, focusing on the integration and coordination of various agents. These architectures are being tailored for practical application in industries and are being integrated into the market alongside small language models (SLMs) for domain-specific knowledge.
  - **Reinforcement Learning Techniques:** Actively exploring and mastering various reinforcement learning strategies, particularly through DPO, focusing on fine-tuning SLMs that can adapt and excel in a myriad of environments and domain-specific scenarios.
  - **Large Language Models (LLM) Evaluation:** Engaged in the systematic evaluation of Large Language Models, understanding their strengths, limitations, and potential, with particular emphasis on real-world applications and implications.
  - **Latent Diffusion Algorithms:** Delving into the intricacies of latent diffusion algorithms, studying their efficiency, scalability, and performance, with an eye toward harnessing these powerful tools for robust and reliable AI solutions.
