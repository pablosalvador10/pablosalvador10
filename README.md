ðŸš€ **Hello, World! Iâ€™m Pablo, a seasoned Full Stack Data Scientist & ML/AI Engineer!**

ðŸ“š **About Me:**
I have a mix of software engineering and strong math skills. As a full-stack AI practicioner, I integrate advanced theory with practical application and I work hard crafting AI/ML solutions at scale for Fortune 500 giants. I'm particularly interested in Generative AI and LLMOps.

**Check out my blog:** [Pablo's AI Corner](https://pabloaicorner.hashnode.dev/)

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently working on:** 
- **Complex Agent-Human Interaction:** Diving deep into the intricate dynamics of how automated agents and humans interact, aiming to enhance the synergy between users and AI-driven systems for optimized outcomes.
- **Multi-Agent Architectures**: Designing and implementing multi-agent architectures to solve real-world problems, focusing on the integration and coordination of various agents. These architectures are being tailored for practical application in industries and are being integrated into the market alongside small language models (SLMs) for domain-specific knowledge.
- **Reinforcement Learning Techniques:** Actively exploring and mastering various reinforcement learning strategies, particularly through (DPO), focusing on fine-tunning SLMs that can adapt and excel in a myriad of environments and but in domain specific scenarios.
- **Large Language Models (LLM) Evaluation:** Engaged in the systematic evaluation of Large Language Models, understanding their strengths, limitations, and potentials, with particular emphasis on real-world applications and implications.
- **Latent Diffusion Algorithms:** Delving into the intricacies of latent diffusion algorithms, studying their efficiency, scalability, and performance, with an eye towards harnessing these powerful tools for robust and reliable AI solutions.

ðŸŒŸ **Highlights:**
- Established & led an MLOps practice, deploying both real-time & batch ML solutions globally at [Concentrix](https://fortune.com/company/concentrix/fortune500/) consulting services.
- Principal author & designer of the MLOps accelerator framework at [Levi's & Co Tech](https://www.fortune.com/company/levi-strauss/fortune500/).
- Co-wrote, developed and engineered a set of Python SDK's (acting as open-source internally) at Levi's & Co Tech., simplifying ML model integration into software for large DS Orgs.
- Designed a state-of-the-art product classification & embedding generation system using advanced Computer Vision algorithms.
- Took the lead in elevating numerous algorithms to production-grade ML systems within Fortune 500 enterprises during my consulting stage at Concentrix! From conception to deployment !

ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:** 
- Open-source challenges, innovative product ideas, and partnerships with bright AI/ML practicioners.
