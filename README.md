### üë®‚Äçüíª **About Me:**  
I work at Microsoft in the Global Black Belt AI team as a Principal AI and Application Development Architect, I fuse deep math and data engineering with hardcore software engineering to launch agentic GenAI solutions that Fortune 500 teams actually use. I turn white-paper theory into revenue-scale AI. On any given day, I‚Äôm elbows-deep in Generative AI, multi-agent orchestration, and LLMOps‚Äîwriting code, shaping the roadmap, and coaching the next wave of builders.

  <summary><h4>üîç What I‚Äôm currently working on</h4></summary>

  - **Secure Real-Time Voice Agents:** Architecting HIPAA-grade, end-to-end-encrypted speech-to-speech pipelines that keep PHI safe while enabling sub-second agentic conversations.
  - **Agentic Protocols & Control Planes:** Designing open communication standards (MCP, A2A) and mapping them onto Azure AI Foundry‚Äôs multi-agent control planes for seamless agent hand-offs.
  - **Production Agentic Memory Layers:** Building hierarchical short-/long-term memory that persist and retrieve context across agent invocations in mission-critical flows.
  - **LLM-App Evaluation & LLMOps:** Creating end-to-end evaluation harnesses to track latency, cost, alignment, and quality of multi-agent GenAI applications before and after release.
